The modular low poly character set of formal cloth. This package is fully compatible with other cloth sets.



The package includes 2 body types with additional 3 subtypes (blendshapes for athletic, overweight, and underweight) and 21 cloth pieces. Textures and materials for subtypes are in the npc_extensions_set_01. Facial customization can be done with detailed blendshapes and 10 face material variants. Every cloth item has a few material variants based on color or normal/AO maps. Upper cloth splits into sub-parts - torso, sleeves. Some meshes have Magica Cloth 2 physics support. Meshes are low-poly and have custom normals, so keeping it is highly recommended.
